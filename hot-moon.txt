Is The Moon Getting Hotter?

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO has discovered something weird happening on the Moon: it’s getting hotter! The LRO was designed to build a detailed terrain map of the Moon’s surface, paving the way for future exploration. It also possesses instruments which map the temperature of the lunar surface, day and night. A recent study of the data collected over the past three years has shown a “lunar warming” trend.

“The warming pattern is surprising, and it appears to be happening very fast.” said Frank Lemon, a co-author of the paper. “It’s far less warming than we’ve seen on Earth in the last few years, but Earth has an atmosphere to hold in heat. The Moon doesn’t have an atmosphere, and its surface is only heated by the Sun.” The paper shows that the change isn’t due any change in the Sun’s output.

“It’s a small change, but very unexpected,” said Maria Zuber, the team’s lead investigator. “We have no explanation for the increase in surface temperature at this time. Although the Moon does have a hot core, like the Earth, there is no evidence of litho-thermal heating. In other words, no Moon volcanoes.”

For decades, orbiters and ground-based telescopes have measured the Moon’s surface temperature. This is the first time in over 50 years that a significant, long-term change has been detected.

The analogy with Global Warming is hard to ignore, but human activity on the Moon has been minimal, to say the least. It does beg the question, was the lunar rover environmentally friendly? Scientists agree, there is no gaseous CO2 on the Moon.




Mysterious Hot Spots Discovered On The Moon

If last week’s announcement by NASA of Global Warming taking place on the moon wasn’t strange enough, things just got even stranger. 

Measurements show that the heating is localized to 17 points around the equator. These points are only a few degrees hotter than the surrounding region, but this temperature difference has been growing steadily over the past week.

“What’s most surprising is their regularity. These spots are each 642 kilometers apart from each other, in a big circle, right along the equator.” said Tiffany Nail, a NASA spokesperson. Nail refused to comment when asked if the regular pattern implies an artificial origin.

“There is no indication that this is a man-made phenomena, like global warming is, here on Earth.” said Bill Nye the Science Guy, who believes the regular hot spots have some natural explanation. “We’ve only been studying the moon carefully for a few decades, but it’s been around for billions of years. These hot spots could be part of some very long heating and cooling cycle.” says Nye.

According to Rick Elphic, a lunar scientist, “We simply don’t know what exists beneath the very thin top layer on the moon.” Lunar orbiters have mapped the moon with spectroscopy, which uses light to analyse the material contents of the surface of the moon. This technique cannot probe below the surface. The core samples taken by the Apollo astronauts only went down about a meter.

Randy Marsh, a geologist from Colorado said, “On Earth, changes in global volcanism have been known to happen throughout history. These changes in overall volcanic activity are usually due to the motion of tectonic plates. But the moon has no tectonic plates, and volcanism on the moon is thought to have ceased over a billion years ago.”




The Curious Case of Lunar Hot Spots

The moon has been a “hot topic” since NASA detected global warming occurring there, last month. The warming seems to be centered on 17 equidistant loci around the equator of our moon.

No government has yet claimed responsibility for these spots. Amidst accusations, the White House issued a statement assuring that the US government is not conducting any missions in the warming regions. NASA officials say that it’s premature to rule out natural explanations for the hot spots.

Others remain skeptical. Some believe the lunar activity to be extraterrestrial in origin. Astrophysicist and science celebrity Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks the spots might be a form of life.  “This goes to show how little we know about our own moon. There may even be life on the moon, maybe not life as we know it, but some biological process energy in an organized way.”

Ground based observations have detected small albedo changes at the center of the hot spots. Dr. Geoff Blake of the Keck telescope in Hawaii says “We think dust at the very center of each spot has been blown off, or heated enough to change color. This has allowed us to pinpoint their positions very accurately.”

Although these changes are not visible to the naked eye, wild claims amature astronomers have been circulating the Internet. So far, subtle albedo changes are the only confirmed visible change. Because the moon is more than 35,000 kilometers away, it’s hard to spot even large objects, like the Apollo landing sites.

There are even those who suspect the whole ordeal is a hoax by NASA to get funding. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sparked a controversy when he tweeted “Seems like #HotMoon is a clever ploy to get NASA funding.” Few take this accusation seriously, though.
