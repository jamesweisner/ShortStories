Chapter 1: A Dream More Real.

I grew up in South San Jose. My father worked construction and my mother looked after us kids full time. There was me, my two brothers, and my sister. I was the oldest, so I got stuck helping mom in the kitchen. Which was fine by me, any excuse to take a break from homework.

I remember the strength she put into kneading the masa when she made tortillas. I watched her turn ingredients into meals. It was pure magic. Once she caught me sneaking food before dinnertime. I was ready for her to slap my hand away but something seemed to stop her. Instead, she said, "Go ahead. Spoil your appetite. See how you feel later."

Well, I stuffed myself with plain tortillas and plenty of stray cuts of meat. I even dug my grubby fingers into the refried beans. By dinner time I sat down, but I wasn't hungry. I couldn't eat anything. I wasn't really part of dinner. I felt so alone. Like I was apart from the family. I hated it.

In school the next day our class learned about the heart rate of a hummingbird and a tortoise. How they're so different in frequency, but the total number of beats in a lifetime for each animal is almost the same. And how humans lie somewhere in between.

This was the moment my destiny changed. I knew that I had to make every meal count. Shrink says it was awareness of my own mortality. That's bullshit. You know how kids are. They think they're gonna live forever, right up until their first gray hairs. No, this wasn't some Ernest Becker nonsense. This was a calling. Every meal had a purpose. To nourish the body. And the heart.

I kept helping my mother in the kitchen, until High School graduation. My parents expected me to apply for college, but I knew I couldn't leave home. I got a really shitty job, but at least I was in the right place. And it was good.

But, well, nothing lasts forever. Youth is wasted on the young, you know? Life brought me nowhere, which was fine by me. Lousy girlfriends, shitty jobs, lots of drinking, running with the wrong crowd. My siblings moved away, my parents passed away, and life kind of just passed me by.

One night my buddies and I went out drinking. They talked about their families. I just sort of listened. And drank. A lot. One by one they all went home. Always with good excuses. Can't miss Church in the morning or some shit. But not me. I kept drinking until the bar man had to cut me off. I staggered down the street, squinting, dazzled by the stained glass blur of neon lights. Took me a while to remember where I was. My old neighborhood from growing up. And I was hungry.

So I made my way to this authentic taqueria in the rough part of town. Taqueria Tijuana, they call it. Really, it's the only thing keeping the gangs off that street corner. Neutral territory. It had to be. Everyone's gotta eat.

I ordered some tacos carnitas and poured myself into one of the booths. I ran my fingers along the thick painted mural on the wall. Some Mayan or Aztec scene of peasants farming, or some shit like that. I thought to myself, "This place is good. It's authentic." I felt safe for the first time in a while. I felt at home. Like if I died right here, right now, it wouldn't be so bad, now, you know? And I was so drunk, I tell you, I thought I was gonna die.

But the next thing I remember was being startled awake to the sound of two plates set down loudly in front of me. It smelled so damn good! I was transported to my childhood. I was sitting at the family table again. And this was my mother's home cooking. I took the first bite and the illusion was so vivid, I really believed somehow that I was there. It was so real. And I felt relieved, like waking up from a bad dream. Tears of joy rolled down my cheeks. The moment of bliss seemed to last forever. But then it began to fade. And I felt like I was falling. Like on a rollercoaster.

And just like that I came to my senses. I felt a lot more sober than I had just a minute ago. Or an hour? God knows how long I had sat there, entranced. Finally, I looked up to find the store owner standing over me, arms crossed, but smiling. She was old. Very old. But she looked strong. After a moment of eye contact she put on a stern face and said, "Looks like you were hungry."

My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. "Yeah. Starving. Hey, you probably hear this a lot, but this is really good." I said, shaking the taco still in my hand. "Really authentic. Like, it's something special, you know? Like, for a moment there... it felt like I left my body. Or at least I daydreamed that I had."

Her eyebrows raised. She waited for a long while for me to go on. Or to show I was joking, maybe? I felt like I couldn't speak. Like I had ankyloglossia or some shit. It was all I could do to make a pained expression and look down. She put her hands on the table, her head close to mine and whispered so soft I could barely hear her, "Did it by any chance feel like the daydream was real? More real than this?"

I slowly looked up at her again. I reached out and gently rested my hands on top of hers. I felt the large knuckles, hard as stones under my fingertips. I worked up the courage to look her in the eyes and whispered, "Yes!"

Chapter 2: One Possible Future.

I don't remember how I got home. I slept dreamlessly and all through the morning. I spent the rest of the day in a haze. Not just hung over, physically. Emotionally hung over. All I could think about was the daydream. I fasted all day, thinking of my next meal. I wanted it to be as special as last night. I went for a long walk. I was comfortable in my shirtsleeves despite the cool air. I marveled at the bright red Liquidambar trees showing their full autumn colors. I just kept walking for hours, as the sun set.

Without really meaning to, I had walked all the way back to Taqueria Tijuana. The smell drew me inside. There were other customers this time. But nobody was in line. It was just past the dinner rush. A young woman tended the register. I pretended to study the menu for a beat and started to order. But she interrupted me, "Tacos carnitas, verdad?" I nodded, paid up, then sat down in my booth.

"What am I doing?" I thought to myself. It seemed crazy to eat here two nights in a row. Like I was intruding. I felt self conscious about my day long obsession with this place. I worried I was losing my mind or some shit. "Maybe I need to stop drinking?" I asked myself. Somehow, I didn't think that was right.

The mural caught my eye again and I examined it more closely. With sober eyes. A young woman held a large wicker basket. She was harvesting corn. She was Mayan, judging by the puffy logograms and Chichen Itza looking temple in the background. The painter had captured motion so well, I felt like I could hear the dry stalks rustling in the wind.

Just then the store owner walked my way with two plates of tacos. I saw her face light up when she recognized me. "Welcome back. I've been expecting you."

"Wow, for real? How'd you know I'd be back?"

"What do you mean? You told me yesterday. After your... daydream."

"Oh, um, I was sort of black out drunk, you know?"

She rolled her eyes at me. Then gave a conspiratorial peak over her shoulder. "This will help you remember," she said as she tossed both plates in front of me. She walked back into the kitchen.

I ate in ecstasy. I felt great love and safety. But unlike the before, it didn't seem real. It wasn't a daydream. Just a fantastic meal.

I waited until all the other customers had left. Then I approached the register. The young woman had already started walking away before I could finish asking, "Can I talk to the owner?" 

The old woman walked out to greet me, wiping her hands on a white cloth towel. She extended one hand and said, "You can call me Patli."

I shook her hand and replied, "Yea, Patli, that's Mayan, right? Like the mural?" She made a face and didn't let go of my hand.

"Oh, sorry, me llamo Eloy." She smiled and let go.

"Nice to meet you, Eloy. Yes, the mural is Mayan, like my name. I've always felt a close connection to my heritage. So, was it like before? Did you have another vision?"

"A vision? No. I mean, don't get me wrong, the food was great! But it wasn't like last night."

She shrugs. "Vision is a rare gift. You're lucky. I've only seen vision once, myself. And I was much older than you. That's how I decided to start Taqueria Tijuana. I saw this business, the mural, the booths, everything. I smelled the food. I heard the patrons speaking. It was so real. I tried to see vision again, many times. I tried everything. It never came. If I wanted those sights, smells, sounds, I'd have to make it a reality. That's when I decided owning my own restaurant was my journey."

"So, you saw a vision of the future?" I asked.

She took a minute to consider my question. "No, not 'the' future. One possible future."

"But my vision, if that's what we're calling it, was of my past. I was at home with my family."

She took a slow breath and sighed. "Vision shows you what you need to see. For me, it was this." She gestured to the restaurant around us. "For you, it was a memory of your past. Tell me, how would you describe that memory, in one word?"

Immediately the word came out of my mouth: "Autentica." Startled, I tried to explain myself. "I mean, it was authentic home cooking. From my mother's side of the family."

"Where is your mother from?"

"Well, she grew up in Tijuana."

"Then Tijuana is where your journey begins."

Chapter 3: Tijuana.

I had plenty of time for second thoughts on the drive down to San Diego. "What am I looking for?" I wondered to myself. It was the dead of night by the time I reached the border. Road signs asked me if I had anything to declare for customs. "Not really. Just a suitcase full of clothes." 

I checked into the motel but couldn't fall asleep. So I went to walk the downtown strip. The streets were mostly empty. A hint of blue belied the eastern sky. I found some people lined up for something. I wandered over to check it out. I stood in line behind a long haired man and his young daughter. "Hey, what are we waiting for?" I asked.

The daughter turned to me and smiled widely. She was dressed up in full Day of the Dead skeleton makeup. She said, "Barbacoa!" Apparently these people thought it worth the wait. So I stuck around. Soon enough the metal gate was raised and I got my first glimpse of the rustic interior. I followed the small crowd into the restaurant, but to my surprise, people were filing past the register and into the back.

"Where are you going?" I asked, slightly concerned.

"We go to watch the opening of the oven." We filed through the kitchen out the back of the building into an awning-covered courtyard. On one side was a tall fence with barbed wire facing the alley. On the other side of the fence a few young kids were watching the spectacle with obvious excitement. In the center of the court yard was a large brick platform. The platform was circular, about 6 feet wide, and no more than a foot tall. It's flat top was covered by a heavy metal plate. This was cemented in place by a thick layer of clay or mud around the circumference.

A man was using his bare hands to tear away the clay. He then used a short-handled straw brush to seep away any remaining dirt. Another man came out of the kitchen and helped him lift the heavy lid. A powerful aroma of citrus and lamb flooded the still morning air. The two restaurant employees, taqueros I think they're called, set down the lid. I stood on my tiptoes to peer inside. There were green fleshy leaves covering whatever lay deep inside the pit oven. The taqueros took turns leaning into the pit to retrieve the leaves one by one. The woman standing next to me saw my scrupulous expression and said, "Agave." Once the leaves had been removed, they reached way down, bent over the rim of the oven, to hoist up large cuts of meat.

They pulled out quarters, organ meat wrapped in stomach casings, and ribs. These were placed on a large metal table. Once the table had been piled high with meat, both men labored to lift an enormous pot from the bottom of the pit. It was filled with juices collected as the meat cooked overnight. I looked at the woman standing next to me and smiled expectantly. "Consumé," she replied.

One man took his station at its center of the table and started working on a large rib section. He dove three fingers into the pile of meat and pulled them out again, holding three small rib bones. It was like watching a crane plucking fish from a pond. He repeated this kung fu surgical operation several times until he seemed satisfied that the offending bones had all been removed.

Then he began making tacos. With one hand, he pulled a corn tortilla from a tall stack. With the other, he pinched off a generous portion of barbacoa, then threw it into the tortilla and handed it to the first person in line. The man was an absolute machine. He pitched meat into tortillas until the whole pile of rib meat was nearly gone.

The other man ladled consumé broth into small bowls. When I was handed my taco, I received it with outstretched palms and held it like a baby bird. Then, mindful of the people who stood behind me in line, I grabbed a bowl of consumé and stood aside to eye my prize. Not five minutes ago this meat lay deep in the ground. These men raised it from the underworld. It felt so sacred. Like a masa-wrapped eucharist. The blood and the body. Still warm from its sacrifice by fire the night before.

As I was staring in wonderment at my food, the guy standing next to me, that same long haired man, loudly licked his finger tips. Then he pointed at my food and said, "Better eat while it's still hot." I took the hint. The meat was heavenly. I went back several times, to try each different cut of meat. The stomachs were opened to reveal liver, heart, and other organ meats I didn't recognize. But they were all good.

As people finished eating, conversations started to pick up. I got to talking with the long haired man. Turns out his name is Danny. And his daughter in Day of the Dead skeleton makeup is Isabella. When I let on that I'm visiting Mexico, not that he hadn't already probably figured that out, he asked what brought me here. "Well, really, I'm just looking for authentic Mexican food."

His daughter, who had been crouched down, poking at ants or something on the ground, suddenly jumps to her feet and exclaims, "I know the most authentic Mexican food! I know, I know!" Danny winces at this interruption. He motions to settle her down, but she backs out of arms reach and chides, "Tell him, daddy. Tell him!"

Danny takes a big breath in and closes his eyes. "She's talking about this is one place, from my hometown. She's not wrong. It's the most authentic Mexican food you'll ever find. But it's far from here. In rural Yucatan. Very rural, you see."

I didn't hesitate. I was all in at this point. "Oh, that's no trouble. Please, how do I find this place?" I asked.

"Well, that's the thing. It's kind of a secret. I can't tell just anybody. Or it would be overrun with tourists. I feel like I can trust you." Then, sternly and directed at his daughter. "It seems Isabella feels the same way." She just laughs and turns back to her ants. "God knows why." Then, in a hushed tone, "But you have to promise me you will keep this secret to yourself. And to be sure you keep your word, I'm sorry, but I need collateral. Comprendo?"

"You want money? How much?"

"Not money..." He looks around to make sure we aren't drawing attention. "Pasaporte."

"You want my US passport?!" I whisper harshly. By way of explanation, he pulls his long hair back, off his shoulders, into a ponytail. Only then did I realize that, without the lion's mane haircut, and perhaps with a close shave, he really would look like me. Same deep brow ridge. Same dark eyes. Same lanky build. "Then how am I supposed to get home?"

"Oh, I'll give it back to you. You go to Yucatan, I go to California. We'll meet back here and I'll give you back your passport."

"How do you know I won't share the location after I get back my passport?"

"I know you won't. Not after."

Authentically Mexican. Mayan. Neanderthal. And all the branches of the tree. All alive. All connected. By food, love, and family.

And by the Sun rising in the East. Sightlessly watching it all. Pushing it all downstream. Well, mostly downstream.
