The Lunarians
-------------

This story is about people living on The Moon about 100,000 years in the future. An atmosphere is kept under a living tent that covers nearly the entire surface. The surface is a lush jungle dotted with cities. These cities are generally situated inside ancient impact craters. The sky is suspended by air pressure and stabilized by alighting on the tree tops. Enormous fossil trees make for a high vaulted sky in many areas.

Material trade, genetic, and cultural mixing are driven mainly by groups of nomadic peoples called "festivals". There are two kinds of festivals: light and dark. The festival of light avoids ever crossing the terminator line into night time. The festival of darkness avoids ever crossing the terminator line into the day time. Troubled youths are often sent to the festival of darkness which caters to carnal and eccentric personalities. The festival of light provides a more structured, sophisticated environment and is typically peopled by those seeking higher learning and enlightenment.

Technology and history have been largely forgotten. Some obvious vestiges remain. The sky is a living artifact of the forgotten technological era. Basic scientific knowledge like the age and extent of the universe, the origin of life, etc. are common knowledge but people no longer have access to the technology required to confirm many of these mythical truths. Magic and religion are socially unacceptable. The human need for spirituality and ritual finds home in the festivals and in other walks of life.

The Lunarians know they came from Earth, which is visible only on one hemisphere of The Moon, where it hangs, forever unmoving in the sky. They communicate with people on Earth by lighting fires all across the face of The Moon all at once. This is done at certain times in a sort of game of call and response with the people of Earth who almost always respond in kind.

The Lunarians alive during the events of the story are the victors of a great war in which the people living underground came to the surface once it was lush and habitable. As it is remembered, they killed off the “native” inhabitants of the surface, who were the ones who worked for centuries to transform the once-dead surface into an Eden.

These natives of the surface embraced high technology much more than those living underground. They heavily augmented their bodies with biotechnology. The most iconic result is they had wings and could fly. For this reason they are known to the living Lunarians as “The Angels”.

The Lunarians have a deep cultural guild about the Angel genocide. The big reveal in this story is that the Angels weren’t literally murdered so much as they were forced to give up technology by a wave of Luddism. All living Lunarians are descendants of both Angels and those who lived underground.

Caller Troy knelt beside the tent and listened with his eyes shut. From inside the tent he can here Kaye's hushed voice.

"I Know you're angry, but you mustn't let the anger control you."

A pause. Then a loud male voice. "How? How can I do that? I can't control the anger. I am the anger. The anger is me."

Troy silently unbuckles the clasps holding his leg armor.

"No, Ajax," she pleads, "you are in control. You are your thoughts. Feelings are imperfect tools. We use them when they're useful. The hammer doesn't control the architect."

Another long pause. He unbuckles the clasps holding his chest armor. He hears russling of leaves in the breeze.

He slowly removes his helmet and places it silently on the dirt. The crackling of the campfire.

Then the sound of comotion from inside the tent. Kaye says something muffled that sounds like, "What are you..."

He strips off the freed armor and bends down to withdraw his knife from its ankle holster.

He jumps onto the tent and madly slices then slips into the torn hole.

Inside he sees what he feared most. Ajax has one hand over Kaye's mouth and the other on her windpipe.

As he becomes aware they are no longer alone in the tent, he moves both hands to her neck and screams aloud, "I am the anger! The anger is me!"

The words are for Troy but Ajax doesn't even turn around to face him.

Troy plungest the knife into Ajax at the neck. His body convulces then slumps to the ground.

Troy throws the blade to the ground and holds his hands against the wound.

Ajax looks up at him, bewildered. He mouths the words, "Just like that?"

Troy nods and answeres, "I can't let your anger hurt this troup, Ajax. You're family to me. But I can't let you hurt the rest of my family."

Ajax closes his eyes. "You'll burn me up. Like garbage."

Troy shakes his head. "I'll keep you with me for as long as I live. I'll keep the anger alive. It will be a candle flame that burns within me for as long as I live.

I won't forget it. But neither will I let it consume me. Like it consumed you. I'll light a candle for you before each sleep."

Ajax, startled, opens his eyes and looks fearfully at Troy. He shutters a little. Then he is gone.

The rest of his day passes by like a dream. He talks to the troup. He washes the blood of his hands. He sits crying while the body is prepared for cremation.

Then finally he is alone in his tent. Finally he can sleep. He unrolls his bed and hangs up his armor. He sets out a small candle and lights it.

"Ajax, you are not annihilated. Your anger lives on within me. The was no justice for you in this cosmos. I keep this flame alive to remember your pain."

Troy sets out another candle and lights it.

And then another. And another...
