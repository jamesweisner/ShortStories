Characters:
Tashi Garner
Born: Wednesday, December 16, 2009
Nickname: Tosh
Peter Garner
Born: 1979
Nickname: Pete

Questions:
Father
How old was Tosh when his father died?
When did he decide to follow clues left by his father?
How did he meet his wife? Where is she?
Married Rashmi, who died when Tosh was 4 from complications due to surgery to repair a heart defect.
Amitabha
Are Tosh and Peter the only ones to discover and communicate with it?
Interconnected web of nanomachines in the Oort cloud.
Reciting its name is significant to Buddhism.
How do you recite the name of a nanomachine web?
It’s name is it’s address, or communication frequency?
Did it seed the young Earth with the genetic code? (Father to all life)
Aliens who made the nanomachines also seeded earth with the genetic code.
Also important to “contemplate his image”.
Use telescopes to find clues?
How does this contrast with “Buddha’s real appearance”?
Fontanelle implant
Storage for a human brain.
Built by nanomachines in phase the first turn of the wheel.
Protagonist decide to leave Earth, he has no reasons left to stay.
Dead loved ones, besides parents? Lost lover? Failing health?

It seems like the Buddhist challenge is to remember and recite his name.
Maybe this act helps solve the space traveler’s challenge of cosmological timescales.
To remember and recite his name is to map a protocol onto the human mind.
This establishes a mechanism for the nanomachine web to communicate with a person directly.
This also allows for download of thoughts and, eventually, an entire human mind.
I won’t over-think this too much, it will be magical and unrealistic, but important for the story.
Moments:
Religious skeptic asks protagonist, “Why was Buddhism given these truths, and not Christianity? Do you mean to say that Buddhism is the one true religion?”
Protagonist answers, “No, these analogies are no more than coincidences which I use to explain to my followers. Universal truths must be uncovered by walking the path of science. Religion is limited to the wisdom of our ancestors. They had millenia to examine the human heart, but no way to examine the Oort cloud.”
Protagonist sits in the lotus position, calmly enduring physical hardship as his body and the whole temple its self are joined with the Amitabha nanomachines. A light parts the clouds and coherent purple light illuminates the surrounding mountain top. The amplitude increases and mirrors sprout from the temple walls. Reflected light encircles the building in a complex and dynamic web. Flames erupt from a circular ring around the mountain top and the rock crumbles away to reveal an intricate network of shining metal cloaked in flame and haze. The haze and dust flashes in the blazing purple light. The temple, and it’s precious human cargo safe inside, rise from the mountainside with barely visible slowness. As the craft accelerates upward, Protagonist issues his final webcast to the world. “When my life approaches its end, and all obstructions be swept away, I will see Amitabha Buddha, and be born in his Land of Ultimate Bliss and Peace.”
Protagonist waves his hand to end this final broadcast. The computer console is consumed by a tangle of metallic roots which spring forth from the floor. He resumes the contemplative pose, and practices mindfulness as a mortal for one final time. The temple ascends into the sky. He is greeted by a vision of Amitabha, an expression of serenity on the face of the Bodhisattva. The floor beneath him bursts into flame. His body is engulfed in the conflagration. After the fire has consumed his body, all that remains is the fontanelle implant, suspended in the vacuum by a magnetic field. It will remain there for billions of years, until the next day of Brahma. He enters the pure land and is finally united with his compassionate father. Together they sing across the galaxy, “Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars...”

Organization and plot:

The First Turning (Buddhism)
Introduction to protagonist
Follow his life up to adulthood
He tells us stories of his father in between tales from his childhood
incorporate Buddhist teachings while telling the story
The Second Turning (Science)
he follows his father’s path to cosmology and astronomy
book learning! make the reader WORK for it
The Third Turning (Enlightenment)
webcast announcement and global conversation
purple clouds
afterward:
what happens to earth, more people follow
conversations in the pure land, get to ask god questions!

Scene: The year is 2020. New Horizons has sent back controversial data on a Kuiper belt object named Amita. This object was discovered by citizen “ice hunters”, and is shown to be in fact a pile of smaller objects clumped together by fingers of icy rock. While nothing like it has been seen before, most astronomers dismiss notions that it is anything other than a previously unseen natural phenomena. Shortly before the closest approach of the fly-by, New Horizons experiences an interruption in communication, spurring further speculation and wild hypothesis. When the craft comes back into communication, numerous subtle anomalies are scrutinized by the growing following of alien enthusiasts. NASA public relations, having learned from the Face on Mars, etc., launches a campaign to quench the conspiracy theorists. Peter is on the team tasked with explaining the communications blackout.
    I came home from school to find my father’s study door closed. I concluded he was hard at work because I could hear the voice of Frank Sinatra seeping through the oak door. The music was eerily muffled from its journey through half a century of transforming audio media, and a quarter inch of aged, lacquered wood. I briskly walked down the darkened hallway and emerged into to the window-lit kitchen. Despite my efforts to block it, the Sinatra tune had lodged itsself firmly in my head. Like an unwanted house guest, the swanky refrain looped over and over, “Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars. Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars...” Impatiently I withdrew a mishmash of ingredients from the fridge to make a sandwich. Then, I was off to eat my sandwich in the middle of the floor in my father’s study. It seemed the correct place for the task. “After all”, I thought, “he might need my help!” I dashed back down the hall and burst into the study. My father was hunched in the computer chair, and dense table of numbers scrolling slowly down the monitor barely a foot in front of his scrunched up eyes. He didn’t acknowledge my presence at all, but of course he knew I was there.
“Hey dad, found any aliens today?” I asked, knowing it would provoke a response.
    “Why, yes, one just walked right into my study! An ugly one, too.” He retorted as he sat up in a slow transformation from a pitiful hunchback to an alert impressive figure.
    “Your jokes are so lame.” I chided, and plopped down on the floor, paper-plated sandwich in hand. “You hungry?” I asked, begrudgingly offering a half of my culinary experiment with an theatrically outstretched arm. Before waiting for a response, I withdrew the arm and took a bite.
    “No, thanks.” came his belated but sincere reply. “What is in that, anyway? Peanut butter and salami?”
    “Peanut butter and JELLY and salami! I just invented it.”
    “That sounds... good?”
    I considered the flavor as I chewed on the remainder of the salami. “Yea, it’s good. What are you working on, anyway?”
    He slid his finger down a rectangle on the screen to lower the volume to barely audible. “Well, you know how we lost contact with New Horizons last month, and everybody went crazy?”
    “Yeah, the nut-jobs had a field day!” I repeated a remembered phrase from some news show or another, not sure of the meaning, knowing well that it was unkind.
    “I wouldn’t say that, and neither should you. The craft went out of radio contact a dozen times, each event lasting only a few seconds. We don’t know why, but these outages were at regular intervals. We think some source of radio static interfered with our ability to make out its signal. My job is to determine the source of that interference. The signal seems to come from pretty far out there, because all of our Earth and near-Earth instruments experienced the same problem. I’ve been given some observation time on the LLT and the VLA. LLT stands for Large Lunar Telescope, and as you might have guessed, it’s on the Moon. VLA stands for Very Large Array, a telescope in New Mexico. Since the Moon and Earth are so far apart, we will use parallax to find out how far away the interfering signal is, if it’s seen again.”
“What’s parallax?”
“Have you ever held your finger up close to your eyes? Close one eye, and your finger appears here, then close the other eye, and it appears to have moved, relative to the background. That’s parallax, the difference in apparent displacement of objects seen from afar. See, if the signal is lost on Earth but not on the Moon, then we can rule out a source of interference very close by New Horizons.”
“What if they both lose contact at the same time?”
“Then the source of interference is close to the craft, a previously undetected Kuiper Belt object.”
“Or an alien spaceship!”
