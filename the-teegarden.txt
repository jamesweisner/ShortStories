The Teegarden


Chapter 1: New Home

Bobby went to sleep on Earth, but awoke on his new home planet. At first, he was only aware of a painfully bright light. The light dimmed as Michael, his father, knelt over him, and put a hand on his forehead. Bobby tried, ineffectually, to bring the fuzzy world into focus.
“Lay back and relax, son. You’re still under sedation until your body has a chance to heal from the trip. Remember we talked about hibernation? You’ve been asleep, frozen like ice, for 30 years. If you move around too much, now, you will hurt worse, later.”
“But I want to see the city... when can we see the city?” Bobby said, his youthful energy shone through, even under heavy anesthetic.
“You and your sister will have plenty of time to see the city once your strength comes  back. Give it a day or two, and you’ll be up on your feet again. Now, I have to go help mom bring in some supplies. We’ll be living in the ship until everyone’s regained their strength enough to move into the city.”
“Mom and Ginny are okay? They didn’t get sick from hibernation?” Bobby asked, suddenly struck with a worried expression.
“Don’t worry, they’re both fine. Your sister is awake, but she needs her rest. You should rest, too. Let me dim the lights for you.” Michael tapped twice on the wall to bring up a command window. He scrolled to the lighting controls and slid down the room’s main light level.
He bent down to kiss Bobby’s clammy forehead, and left the boy to sleep.

Michael hated to see his children like this. Hibernation had left them with several bruised, oozing patches on their skin, where the tissue had been damaged by the freezing and thawing process. However, those superficial injuries were the least dangerous.
All four family members had been treated, automatically, for damage to their internal organs while they were still unconscious. The shipboard medical equipment was top of the line, but no substitute for a trained professional. Luckily, both he and his wife had received a crash course in cryonic medicine as part of their mission training.
Jane and Michael Valentine were trained on Earth by the Teegarden Foundation. They entered as a team, and won their place on the mission by proving themselves adaptable, useful, and most importantly, eager to leave Earth.
When Michael was born, late in the 23rd century, Earth had long endured its maximum carrying capacity of twenty billion humans. Like any century, the wealthy enjoyed the best the world had to offer of food, land, energy, and protection from the less-than-wealthy. The poor had enough to keep them fed, healthy, and, if content with a meager share of the pie, happy. After all, the world was free of oppression from slavery, religion, oligarchical dictators, military-industrial nation states, omnipowerful corporations, and, once one had become an adult, one’s own parents.
But the Valentines had never been content with a meager share of anything. They had ambition uncommon in their time. They needed more space to raise their children, and grandchildren. They wanted an exciting future for themselves, and their family. The spirit of adventure was alive in them. Both were distant from their families and had few close friends.

They first heard about the Teegarden Foundation from one of their friends, a wealthy financial entrepreneur named Friend.
“So, Friend, what’s this important venture you have to tell us about? I don’t mind the fancy dinner, but I can’t afford any timeshares in Someplace,” said Michael.
“Oh, right, the Teegarden!”
“Tea garden? You planning a trip to Japan?” asked Jane.
“So, you guys really don’t read the news, do you? Teegarden’s star is host to a colonization candidate. You know, a frozen planet, which could never have supported life, so it’s fair game for colonization. Planets even close to the habitable zone of their host stars are off limits to manned missions, less any potential biosphere be contaminated by Earth life.”
“Yeah, we want to emigrate and start a family, but colony dues cost even more than timeshares in Someplace. You aren’t offering to pay for our emigration, are you, dear Friend?” said Michael.
Friend leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers. “You know, for those who can’t afford to buy their way into a colony, there are other options. You are both excellent problem solvers. You could apply for one of the engineering opportunities on this colony mission.”
“ ”
*** when does it leave? how do they apply? what’s the job description?

Explain their job: engineers to get the city ready for arriving citizens. They were delayed a few years until the city was ready for them. They have years of work to do until the citizens can arrive, and are in a hurry. Citizens will be upset by further delay, and they don’t want to be alone, which is dangerous, scary, and lonely. But, at least nobody is breathing down their neck. More, they are self-motivated types. The parents get right to work, and send the kids out to explore the city.

Chapter 2: Empty City

    Bobby and Ginny walked down the gangplank, and onto the huge, empty landing. The air was cool, and their new Sun, Teegarden’s Star, glowed humbly behind them. It was like a bright moon, low in the sky. Their shadows were skinny giants. The bowl shape of the city lay before them like a huge, round valley. They could see down the gentle slope to its center, where tall buildings bunched close together.
The city center was surrounded by vast countryside, covered with rectangles of varying shades. Many were green, covered by grasses or trees. Others were empty plots of reddish regolith, not yet transformed into proper soil. They could just make out the far rim, which grew thick with white ice where it met the invisible dome that pervaded overhead.
Behind this transparent dome, they could see a black sky full of stars. A thin wisp of orange-red fog spread around the curve of the dome.
“Look at all that green!” cried Bobby.
“Yeah, it goes on forever. I hope our house has a huge yard.” said Ginny.
Bobby scanned up and down the platform. There were no signs on the buildings, no painted arrows on the ground. One long building, he supposed, was the airport’s main terminal. Its walls were unfinished, still a network of cement with rebar sticking out of it. He spotted what looked like the main entrance. Without a word, he started running towards that end of the platform, instigating a race with Ginny.
“Hey, no fair!” she squealed, and chased after him.
They both ran awkwardly in the low gravity, still getting accustomed to a new way of moving. There was little danger that either of them would fall over because, due to lower acceleration, a body had more time to correct. And a fall would be less injurious than on Earth, because a body would hit the ground at a slower speed, resulting in less force of impact.
Still, wobbly balance and misjudged strides made for an entertaining race. As they neared the door, they both halted in surprise as a vehicle drove out the doorway. It looked like a sort of tiny dump truck, with too many arms, and no cockpit for a driver. It travelled along quietly, without the simulated engine noise common to all electric vehicles back on Earth.
“It’s not making a warning noise.” said Bobby. “We have to be careful not to let any machines sneak up on us, especially around blind corners. Remember what dad said, the safety protocols aren’t perfect.”
They waited patiently, while the vehicle rolled off to perform some unknown task. Then they entered the airport through a huge, unfinished archway. The interior was dimly lit by Sunlight through this one, large opening. Also, deep in the dark building, were several ruddy lights strewn haphazardly along the floor of the hallway.
They stepped along cautiously, at first, because their long shadows made it hard to see where they were going. Then they came into the glow of one of the red lights, and began to stride less cautiously.
Just as they were about to leave its comfortable glow, the light seemed to move towards them. The motion was accompanied by the sound of an electric motor which echoed off the empty walls. Both children jumped forward and let out a yell of surprise.
“Eeek! What’s out there? Is it following us?” shrieked Ginny. She turned around and squinted into the darkness.
Bobby took hold of Ginny’s hand, and together they took a few steps forward. The source of light responded, closing the distance. “I think you’re right. It’s following us. The lights must be autonomous.”
He stepped closer to the light, and it didn’t move away. He held up one finger to blot out the point of light. With the glare reduced, he could make out the robot body of the source of light. It looked like a small traffic cone with wheels. He took another step closer, and it backed away slowly.
The otherwise smooth metal body was striped by several shadows cast by little protrusions near the pointy top. Bobby suspected these shielded the robot’s cameras from the glare of its own light.
“It’s just a tiny thing. I think it’s safe enough. Well, at least we won’t have to feel our way in the dark,” said Bobby.
“How are we gonna find the rail station, even if we can see where we’re going? There aren’t any signs up, at least none that I can make out in the dark.” said Ginny.
“I know where to go, don’t worry. The terminal is on the other end of this long hallway. From there, we can take the light rail to downtown, see the big buildings, and then . It’s a good thing I like to ‘waste my time’ studying those ‘stupid maps’ of the colony, huh?” said Bobby.
“Wouldn’t be like that if there were signs up, or if we could use our phones,” muttered Ginny. 
*** wait, they should have cell phones. why wouldn’t those work? as flashlights, and to find a map.

Bobby and Ginny explore the city, in its ghostly emptiness. They are excited to have so much free space, because back on Earth, they lived in a cramped apartment in a packed city. As children, they were always under the yolk of supervision, but now they have unbridled dominion over an entire city.

Introduce the planet: icy, dead, 75% Earth gravity, short year, no geology, thin atmosphere without free oxygen, dim star, low UV. Dome protects from solar wind and cosmic rays.

The kids find evidence of someone living in the city before their arrival. their parents don’t believe them.

Chapter 3: Neighbors
They go outside the dome to meet neighbors in a dome nearby. At dinner the parents talk more about the trip from Earth, the plan for this colony, etc.

Chapter 4: Accident
Bobby is almost injured in an accident, which doesn’t seem very accidental. Figureprint is found on the airlock confirm the suspicion. everybody has their med-chips checked for a match to the fingerprint.

Chapter 5: Manhunt
time passes, and they capture a photo of a human child, about the age of the Bobby and Ginny. they learn his routine and form a plan to capture the kid.

Chapter 6: Stowaway
the stowaway kid is captured, and he tells his story. he is a clone, his “father” hacked the code for his creation into the design for the city. his “mother” was cloned, too, but she died in an accident a few years back. there are pairs of them in each of the cities.

since he was alone, he thought to take Ginny as his new companion, and he tried to get rid of the Bobby as competition. he has stunted emotional development, and thinks like the machines that built the city, since they were the major unpredictable elements of his life growing up.

Chapter 7: Cooperation
There is a crisis and the stowaway helps them overcome it. They meet the other stowaways in other towns. Each clone has a unique identity, but all share the same temperament as their genetic equals.

They get the town ready, and eventually welcome the citizens and throw them a planet-warming party.

Fun Facts:
Length of a day (from sunrise to sunrise) equals length of a year (planet transits star).
It looks like the other stars in the sky move twice as fast as the sun.
Each 29 Earth days is 2 Earth weeks of sun followed by 2 Earth weeks of darkness.
Stars show same at sunrise and sunset, except the sun is in opposite ends of the sky!
