Interstellar Bistro
-------------------

Earth’s first contact with an extra-terrestrial technological civilization was typical of such encounters in the outer-spiral-arm backwater. When the Interstellar Bistro first began to decelerate from 75% light speed, it was just outside the orbit of Neptune. Its brilliant exhaust flame was impossible to miss as a new star outshining all but the moon in the night sky. The UN's then-appointed space ambassador, having seen one too many Bruce Willis movies, broadcasted to the world his promise to defend Earth by force if necessary. As you can imagine, the denizens of the approaching restaurant were duly outraged.

But once the people of Earth took the time to establish a radio communication, their fears were quickly abated. Their reputation as fierce warriors, however, remains to this day.
