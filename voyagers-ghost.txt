The electromagnetic attraction of the nucleus lost its grip on electrons, and atoms ceased to exist. Now, I could hardly feel the shackles binding me to the scattered nuclei which once made up the golden disk. I was beginning to see myself from a new perspective. I saw my past, present, and infinite future collapsing, rushing towards my point of view. It was as though my world line had been drawn on a piece of paper seen edge on. I felt the loving touch of my wifeâ€™s lips upon mine. I saw the faces of my children, grandchildren, and on to the hundredth generation. I tasted the salty breeze from the day, as a child, I first saw the vast ocean.
    I drifted in this formless dream until, finally, the strong nuclear force could no longer hold together the protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Then those hadrons themselves began to come apart, leaving only naked quarks, each its own solipsistic universe. My history blurred with the history of all things; beings and stars alike. I struggled to retain memory of such oddities as atoms, given the gift of variety in the furnaces of giant stars, flowing through bodies, each playing its insignificant, brief part in the symphony of a body, giving rise to a mind.
    The fields whose vibrations are the fundamental particles were themselves was stretched out flat by the cosmological expansion. But at the subatomic level, the roiling uncertainty in spacetime grew louder and louder. Just as the whole fabric was thrashing so violently I thought it would rip apart, it began to relax again. In that moment that was all of time, in that place that was every place, I became aware of one more truth. Life has no end. It is as the pitted, smooth surface of an egg.
